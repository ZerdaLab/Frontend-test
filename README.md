### Instructions
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple dashboard using the data that can be accessed from the REST API. The dashboard should be able to display the following information:
1. Retrieve data from an API.
2. Plot locations on the map using coordinates provided.
3. Build a cross-plot.
4. Build a bar chart for any field.
5. Add at least one filter (any field of your own choice)

The API can be accessed at this address:

### Submission Guidelines
